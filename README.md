# security-system

The chosen project represents a security system developed in a multiple-room home. It requires an agent (human), and a system driven by an alarm. The events, actions mostly performed by the agent, and the fluents, which are facts or states in which the agent or an object is, are displayed in a logical order in the output, each at its corresponding moment in time. The relationship between the events and the fluents are that an event can trigger a fluent, or can negate it. The order of the actions would be the following : an agent enters his/ hers home through the hallway. The motion sensors of the system silently activate the alarm. The agent is given cca. 15 seconds to enter a passcode, as many times as they want. After the time has passed, the passcode is considered incorrect and the alarm is started. If, however, they managed to enter the correct passcode, the alarm is defused, but only in the room they are in. If the agent desires to defuse the alarm in the whole house, he/ she enter a ’general’ passcode. If not, the agent must defuse the alarm using a monitor placed in every room. If the alarm was triggered in a room, the corresponding camera immediately starts recording. This action is very efficient in the conjecture of a robbery or a break-in.
